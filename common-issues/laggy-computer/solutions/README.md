# Solutions

One reason could be the over-usage of the CPU, causing the clock speed to be limited.

There are a couple of solutions to this.



1. Raise the CPU rate-limiting threshold/s. This is risky because possibly your CPU _is_ actually overheating. However, many mobile CPUs have their temperature threshold set much lower than necessary. Physically, most CPUs can reach 90-95°C before having any problems. My laptop's CPU started rate-limiting at around 75°C, which is unnecessary and frustrating.
2. Limit the number of CPU cores that the offending process/es have access to. This can be achieved from inside Windows Task Manager.
3. Limit the CPU utilization percentage that the offending process/es have access to. This can be achieved using a third-party application called BES (Battle Encoder Shirasé).



Solution 2 is the safest option for you to use because it is a feature built into Windows, and it doesn't alter any hardware configurations.

Solution 1 uses third-party software and risks damaging the CPU (and motherboard!) if you configure it incorrectly. It can also cause OS instability. Visit my [Power User](https://app.gitbook.com/o/HGV4O8QFvR73oXn7Uxww/s/qA7gVdU3GXPI3OOuI1Ep/ "mention") website to use this method.

Solution 3 also uses third-party software, but it doesn't risk any physical damage to the hardware. Visit my [Power User](https://app.gitbook.com/o/HGV4O8QFvR73oXn7Uxww/s/qA7gVdU3GXPI3OOuI1Ep/ "mention") website to use this method.
