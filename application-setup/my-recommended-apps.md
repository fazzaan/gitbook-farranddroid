# My Recommended Apps

Where possible, I will always prefer F/OSS apps over proprietary and paid apps.

You can read about why on another page that I haven't written yet — probably on my personal website.&#x20;



## Text editors&#x20;

**Notepad++** — only runs on Windows. Very configurable. Fast, not laggy. Automatically preserves all your unsaved files. Has syntax highlighting for 80+ languages. Has a dark theme. It is fully open source.

* Download from GitHub — [https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus](https://github.com/notepad-plus-plus/notepad-plus-plus)&#x20;

## Code editors

Until recently, VS Code seemed like the only reasonable app. There are several others, but VS Code features the most useful functionality, extensions, etc; and it is fully cross-platform.

However, yesterday I discovered that there is a fully un-Microsoft'èd version of VS Code, called VSCodium. So far, it seems to be identical to VS Code, except it isn't branded with MS stuff and (hopefully) isn't full of their telemetry & other spyware.&#x20;

**VSCodium** —&#x20;

## Firewalls

**MalwareBytes Windows Firewall Control** — Pretty good, pretty simple, gives you popup notifications that something is trying to access the internet.

Download from their homepage (Binisoft) — [https://www.binisoft.org/wfc](https://www.binisoft.org/wfc)&#x20;



**SimpleWall** — _there is also a fork that I need to check out_. Setting it up is pretty simple, although there's some things to configure, so read my guide ( [firewalls.md](../internet-safety/inside-your-computer/firewalls.md "mention") → [quick-setup-guide.md](../internet-safety/quick-setup-guide.md "mention") ) and also search for information online yourself!

## DNS providers

Using any alternative DNS[^1] provider allows you to circumvent most blocks that have been put in place by your ISP[^2]. Some DNS services also provide a little more privacy, but it is really is only a _little_. More info about DNS, privacy & encryption [here](https://www.privacyguides.org/en/dns/).&#x20;

**NextDNS** — Quite simple to set up and get going.&#x20;

* Download from their homepage, and set up your account — [https://nextdns.io/](https://nextdns.io/)&#x20;
