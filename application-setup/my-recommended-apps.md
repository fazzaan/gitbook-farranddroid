# My Recommended Apps

Where possible, I will always prefer F/OSS apps over proprietary and paid apps.

You can read about why on another page that I haven't written yet — probably on my personal website.&#x20;



## Text editors&#x20;

**Notepad++** — only runs on Windows. Very configurable. Fast, not laggy. Automatically preserves all your unsaved files. Has syntax highlighting. Has a dark theme.

## Code editors

Until recently, VS Code seemed like the only reasonable app. There are several others, but VS Code features the most useful functionality, extensions, etc; and it is fully cross-platform.

However, yesterday I discovered that there is a fully un-Microsoft'ėd version of VS Code, called VSCodium. So far, it seems to be identical to VS Code, except it isn't branded with MS stuff and isn't full of their telemetry & other spyware.&#x20;

**VSCodium** —&#x20;
