### Theme switching and dark mode

So... Windows 11 still doesn't have automatic theme switching between light and dark modes, which is obviously important given that every single OS and most modern websites offer this functionality.

Windows's theme switching method [leaves a lot to be desired](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], and even changing the theme (or even just switching between light and dark mode) often has issues.&#x20;

A team called _AutoDarkMode_ have built a wonderful app that handles automatically switching between light and dark modes on Windows, also taking into account the array of weird bugs and doing their best to circumvent them.

Check it out on GitHub:&#x20;

### Package managers

Here we will discuss package managers that handle system software. Apps like Ninite handle user-space software, which you can learn about in [getting-the-apps-you-need.md](../application-setup/getting-the-apps-you-need.md "mention").&#x20;
