## Browser

{% hint style="warning" %}
Since learning about [_Manifest V3_ in Chromium](#user-content-fn-1)[^1], we can no longer recommend any browser that uses Chromium in its backend. If what I've learned is accurate, this poses a permanent and unavoidable threat to privacy & security.

For that reason, we will suggest only non-Chromium based browsers ‚Äî which appears to be solely Gecko (Firefox) at this point.
{% endhint %}

### Firefox

This is basically the only browser class that I can trust right now, without doing extensive research deeper to learn and understand more.

There are a (small) array of browsers built upon the application source of Firefox.

Firefox includes practically all the same features as Chrome/ium these days so, fear not, you can still restore your tabs, sync your devices, access tabs from other devices, back up your passwords, use popular browser extensions, and much more!

You can also import your browser data from other browsers, so you don't need to lose your history, passwords, bookmarks, etc. Actually, when I installed Firefox yesterday, it already had several extensions that I'm fairly sure I'd only used in Chrome! (Not sure if this is a good thing though ‚Äî depending how this happened, it seems like a privacy risk.)

### Guide for switching browsers

The primary issue with switching browsers is that you might have tonnes of tabs open, with no way to move them over. Well, fear not! You can use the OneTab extension to transfer your tabs.&#x20;
