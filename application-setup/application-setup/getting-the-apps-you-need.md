# Getting the apps you need

there are several package managers and several stores, and also some quick-setup apps which help you by downloading loads of common apps automatically.

These are usually trustworthy sources simply because they are used by millions of people daily, often tech-savvy people too, which doesn't confirm that it is all safe but it does mean that anything awry would likely be detected quickly. The scale of the userbase, and the reputation that the developers have to uphold, makes it a pretty safe bet that the apps in these stores are legit and not compromised.&#x20;
