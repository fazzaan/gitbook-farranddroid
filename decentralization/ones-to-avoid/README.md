# Ones to avoid

There are some bad eggs out there.

I've come across my fair share of pump 'n' dump memecoin crypto scams. (I even fell victim to one.)

This concept is still on-going, in crypto space, in other space, and in their overlap.

There are some decentralized networking platforms which shill for their crypto coin.

Unfortunately, they are tarnishing the name & concept of crypto, because in essence it's actually a pretty good way for us to keep control of our own value system in the present and the future.

Anyway.

Don't worry, I'm not writing this to convince you of anything, especially not to do with crypto.

This page is to highlight some of the platforms, services, apps, etc that I saw, explored a bit, and discovered or decided that something was a bit off, a bit awry.



## 1. Matrix.org

Something about their app and their model is all weird, feels kinda shady.
