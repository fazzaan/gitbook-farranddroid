DeBoot looks to be an incredible project, using software that acts as a node in a decentralised network in order to load an OS boot kernel from a remote source. The node software is loaded in before any actual OS is running, which essentially means you can boot an entire OS remotely without having any administrative control over the machine (except for boot access, of course).

As the nodes are part of a decentralised network, it also means that the code of the OS you use cannot be controlled or blocked. This is a fantastic way to circumvent governmental & corporate control over our devices.&#x20;

I have only just started looking at this so idk if I've fully understood the project yet but I'll keep learning about it, explore and maybe use it, and will write more here as I understand it better.&#x20;
