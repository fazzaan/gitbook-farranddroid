# Decentralised Tech

There used to be a wonderful piece of decentralised, blockchain-like webware called ZeroNet.

It seems to be essentially dead in the water: still available, still operational, but its code hasn't been updated (on GitHub anyway) in over 5 years, and there aren't many users. It really only works when there are an abundance of users.

However, there are many other decentralised web-space technologies, so here I will list a few that I've recently discovered and am currently investigating.

We need a new paradigm for how to communicate through the web of the world.

We need to stop relying on internet providers and centralised server platforms, like Meta and Google and X (ex-Twitter, RIP Blue Bird) and all the rest.



## List of interesting technologies to explore

* Reddit post I got some of these from: [r/ZeroNet/ Is there any service/app similar to ZeroNet?](https://www.reddit.com/r/zeronet/comments/1i1cmf2/is_there_any_serviceapp_similar_to_zeronet/)&#x20;

### IPFS — InterPlanetary File System

_"IPFS is an open system to manage data without a central server."_

Despite the seemingly humorous name, this is a legit platform that has served — and still does — in providing internet access to government-blocked sites. One major event was Turkey blocking Wikipedia in 2017, and IPFS was used to clone Wikipedia and provide un-blockable access to Turkish citizens for 3 years — the govt actually restored access in 2020.&#x20;

### Nostr Apps

I haven't really worked out what this is all about yet, but it seems to be a fundamental communications protocol that is inherently uncensorable, and there are a whole slew of apps built using the nostr protocol.&#x20;
