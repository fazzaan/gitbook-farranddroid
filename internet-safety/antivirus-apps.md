# Antivirus apps

You must not rely solely on _one_ antivirus application; nor should you rely entirely upon antivirus software to protect you.&#x20;

Several times, I have had to chase a virus around my computer, uncovering scripts, tasks in Task Scheduler, the Registry, fake driver entries, and powershell & cmd processes.&#x20;

Even after all that, _and_ using Windows Security (which detected virus files and quarantined them!), Kaspersky still managed to find more malicious code hiding in the RAM.



* Kaspersky Antivirus — you can get a free 30-day trial with each new account. You can make unlimited new accounts by using email aliases. For Gmail, do this by simply adding a + after your email username, and whatever letters you like. E.g. hello+kspsk01@gamil.com, then after 30 days, hello+kspsk02@gamil.com, etc.
  * Kaspersky is the best AV I've found so far. It actually scans the whole system deeply, INCLUDING scanning the RAM for malicious code: many viruses are programmed to hide themselves in the RAM, making it impossible for you to delete them — they will always return after a reboot.
* Windows Security isn't too bad these days, it finds most malicious code. You should still use Kaspersky occasionally, and especially if you are suspicious.
* MalwareBytes seems to be good too. Check it out.
