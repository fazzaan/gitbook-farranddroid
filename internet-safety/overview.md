    **NOTE THAT THIS IS SIMILAR TO A VPN BUT IT IS&#x20;**_**NOT**_**&#x20;A VPN**.

    WARP hides the contents of your messages (a bit) but does not hide your location.

    **USE A VPN IF YOU NEED TO ACTUALLY HIDE YOUR INTERNET TRAFFIC**.

[^3]: Virtual Private Network. _Paid_ VPNs are secure; they hide your location _and_ the contents of your internet traffic.
