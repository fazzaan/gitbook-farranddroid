These days, so much of the internet is just "AI"-generated _slop_.

We all know this is true, no matter how much of a die-hard "AI" proponent you may be.

That said, some of the sites I've linked here may well be partially or fully "AI"-generated.

I've linked them because I used them in resolving issues that I've written about on this website.
