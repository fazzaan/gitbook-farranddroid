### Virtualisation

Virtual machines are nothing new, but getting good performance out of them is less simple.

Recent years have brought "passthrough" virtualisation, in which the VM[^1] software enables direct hardware access for the virtual operating system. In the last couple of years, a new piece of software has been developed which essentially replicates the framebuffer from the VM's GPU into the host's GPU, thereby providing 1-frame-behind-realtime visual access into the VM's graphical output.&#x20;

Virtual machine applications:

* VirtualBox
* QEMU
* Gnome Boxes
* idk actually, it's been years since I used virtual machines. I'll add things to this list later when I'm undertaking this adventure.
