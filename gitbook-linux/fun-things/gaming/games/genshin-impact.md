# Genshin Impact

So it actually works! Right up to version 6.1, which I'm using now.

It's not perfect but it's pretty good.

If you're running in Wayland, with multiple monitors, then set your screens to be diagonally connected because Wayland has a bug with mouse capture in some apps.

In Steam, add the Hoyo launcher as a non-Steam game.

Go into the Steam settings for the game, and set it to use Proton Hotfix.

(This worked for me on 12th of October 2025 so YMMV and you can try a bunch of the Proton options.)



The game renders fine without _latency_, but as I'm using a laptop with an Intel iGPU and an Nvidia dGPU, there were some stutters and spasmodic lagging. So I set the render scale to 0.8x, and the fps to 60, and set my screens to 60Hz output in the Linux system settings, just to reduce load on the graphic processing.

I was able to play the game as normal on Windows, fast-paced battles and everything, no problem.
