# Linux things!

{% hint style="success" %}
YO! IF YOU CAME HERE COS LINUX IS FRUSTRATING YOU AND YOU ARE USING GNOME,&#x20;

## INSTALL KDE PLASMA!!!

IT IS LIGHTYEARS AHEAD OF GNOME AND WHATEVER THE FUCK THEY'RE SMOKING

&#x20;

_also Hyprland is pretty nifty but it's a whole trip so maybe delve into that a bit later._
{% endhint %}

Ok so I used to adore Linux

Nowadays it is just exhausting because I need things to _just work properly without me needing to fuck around with them for hours, days, weeks or months on end_

_Like photoshop and microsoft office â€” now that I'm all growed up and profeshunal I understand what "industry standard" means and frankly gimp and open office just AREN'T good enough // aren't compatible enough with these apps._&#x20;

So please leave it out.



Anyway, that aside, I still love Linux and everything it stands for, and as I transition myself back into it, I'll keep a log here of what I do and what I learn so that it can help you too.
