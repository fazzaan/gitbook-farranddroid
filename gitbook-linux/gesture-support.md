# Gesture Support

Gestures is still a hot mess.

Not the good kind of hot mess.



Here's the best one I've found so far according to the internet, but I haven't testing it much.

It overrides 4-finger gestures, but the 3-finger gestures won't override the GNOME defaults â€” which is stupid because GNOME's defaults replicate the functions between 3- and 4-finger gestures, which is utterly and infuriatingly redundant.



There is a nice extension for Gnome Shell but a) it only works in Gnome Shell and b) its configuration panel is unnecessarily confusing.



In Plasma, custom configurations don't seem to work for loads of things right now.
