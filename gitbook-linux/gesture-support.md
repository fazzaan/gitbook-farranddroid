# Gesture Support

Gestures is still a hot mess.

Not the good kind of hot mess.



Here's the best one I've found so far, without much testing though.

[https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg](https://github.com/JoseExposito/touchegg)&#x20;

It overrides 4-finger gestures, but the 3-finger gestures won't override the GNOME defaults â€” which is stupid because GNOME's defaults replicate the functions between 3- and 4-finger gestures, which is utterly and infuriatingly redundant.
