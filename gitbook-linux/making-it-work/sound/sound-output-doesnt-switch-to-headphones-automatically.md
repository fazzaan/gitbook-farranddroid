# Sound output doesn't switch to headphones automatically

This seems to only be the case when an HDMI output with audio support is also plugged in. So the problem is regarding output selection priority. Clearly if I plug an audio cable into the headphone jack, that means I want the sound to go out of it now. If the system is unsure what I want, it should pop up a question dialog asking which device I want to use. There should also be a method to explicitly set audio output priorities, as well as multi-output configuration. How we reached 2025 and still don't have this kind of configurability is beyond me.
