# Volume isn't loud enough

this is like a COMMON PROBLEM STILL IN 2025



{% hint style="danger" %}
I haven't actually solved this yet.
{% endhint %}



my laptop, MSI ( i know i know ) has LOADS of speakers in it, i think 4or 6 or 8 or idk but basically

basically

the speakers are only activated by specialised software called _**Nahimic**_ which is a steaming pile of pretty great software tbh, people always crap on it online but it actually makes my speakers work well, it has a variety of smart equaliser settings (smart as in, organised by purpose and intention, rather than requiring you to fiddle with specific frequencies n stuff.



anyway, on Linux half the speakers aren't even detected, it seems that they're connected to a different hardware controller that doesn't even get recognised.



idk why this link is here but i must have pasted it for some reason
