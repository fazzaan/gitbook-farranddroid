# Google Drive access

So there truly seems to be no free way to have a _**synchronising**_ Google Drive solution.

You can "stream" it though, via what is essentially a network drive.

This isn't great, because there isn't a dedicated cache of recent or selected files.

It's not very elegant, it has a bunch of issues which would be associated with a network drive.

It shouldn't have, but there we go.

Google, who make A VARIETY OF LINUX-BASED OPERATING SYSTEMS USED BY THE ENTIRE PLANET, AND USE LINUX INTERNALLY, ARE INCAPABLE OF MAKING A LINUX CLIENT FOR THEIR OWN CLOUD STORAGE SYNC SERVICE, GOOGLE DRIVE.
