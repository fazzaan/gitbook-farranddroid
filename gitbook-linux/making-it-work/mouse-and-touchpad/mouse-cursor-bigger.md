# Mouse cursor bigger

Somehow GNOME settings STILL doesn't have a way to change the size of the mouse cursor.

It's not even in Accessibility settings.

Seriously.

Who the&#x20;



anyway



It can be changed.

Run this gsettings command, or install dconf-editor and just tweak things that way.

dconf is basically like Windows's Registry, except you probably can't cause a nuclear meltdown with it.
