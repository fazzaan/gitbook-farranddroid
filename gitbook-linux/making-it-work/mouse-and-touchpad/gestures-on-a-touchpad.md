# Gestures on a touchpad

So far I've only explored GNOME.



There are a load of attempts to develop gestures, but so far I've only found one that I like and that seems robust and implemented in a native-ish way.

It's a GNOME extension, which seems to be the DE dev team's way of gradually developing a walled garden. Would be nice if the Extensions website actually functioned properly tho huh.

Configuring it is a bit of a headache. I'll put some screenshots here.

(I would do a screencast, but I have a dual GPU laptop so _obviously_ my screenrecorder doesn't work.)

My main gripe with it so far is that it doesn't detect swipe direction very cleanly, so my upward swipes often get interpreted as being leftward or rightward even if I only swiped _slightly_ to the side.
