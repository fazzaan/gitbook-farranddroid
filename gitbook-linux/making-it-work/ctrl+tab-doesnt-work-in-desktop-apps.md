# Ctrl+Tab doesn't work in desktop apps

So this is Yet Another GNOME/GTK Problem (_YAGGP_ or _YAGG Problem_).

By that, I mean, _the GNOME team is marching rapidly toward fascism and changing all kinds of random shit seemingly with the sole intention of pissing off as many people as humanly possible._

So, you know <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, that keyboard shortcut that's hard-baked into everyone's brains all around the world?

GNOME have decided that we don't need that any more.

Instead, we're gonna use <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>1</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>2</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>3</kbd>, etc.

Or, perhaps, <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgUp</kbd> and <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>PgDn</kbd>.

And, if you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, the control focus is going to move somewhere else, invisibly, and that means that the other new tab switching shortcuts aren't going to work either! Unless you press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> to reverse the control focus, exactly the right number of times.

And you can't know which apps support which of these tab switching methods.

Also, apps with an unpredictable number of tabs, such as the text editor, only work with <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>number</kbd>.

And also, there are some other tabbed dialogs which actually aren't tabs at all, they're just themed to look the same.
