# WiFi Speed

I haven't fixed this on my second laptop yet.

It works just fine on my main laptop, which is pretty funny considering the absolute nightmare that this specifi wifi chipset is known for on Windows.&#x20;

(Although, lately, I've had no problems with it. I guess Intel sorted their shit out. Always nice when a multinational multi-billion-dollar tech company actually makes things that work, eh?)



Anyway yah, on my second cheapy laptop, my download speed on Windows is 700-900 Mbps, while on Linux it's 250-350Mbps. I haven't done any research about this yet, but it's not a new laptop, and it's HP so it's not rare or weird, so idk why it has a problem.&#x20;
