# Window snap groups

When you snap two (or more!) windows together in Windows, the windows become a _snap group_, and these windows exist as an entry in the window switching interfaces — both in <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and in the taskbar previews.

Gnome Shell has an extension called Tiling Assistant which provides snapped window layouts. The windows also resize together when you resize one of them. <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>bing to one brings them all to the foreground together, as in Windows.

KDE Plasma probably does it too but I haven't explored Plasma much.

It's quite likely that most tiling DEs do it. I'm about to embark on a Hyprland journey, so I'll let you know.

Tiling DEs to check out:

* i3
* sway
* hyprland
* _idk what else exists_
* _im noob_
