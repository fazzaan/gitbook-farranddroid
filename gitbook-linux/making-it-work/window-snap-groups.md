# Window snap groups

I don't have a solution for this.

Basically, when you snap two (or more!) windows together in Windows, the windows become a _snap group_, and these windows exist as an entry in the window switching interfaces — both in <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and in the taskbar previews.

This is _**unbelievably useful**_ and it's a darn shame (and bewildering) that GNOME still doesn't have it.

I have no idea about KDE or others tbh.

It's quite likely that tiling DEs do it. I'm about to embark on a Hyprland journey, so I'll let you know.

Tiling DEs to check out:

* i3
* sway
* hyprland
* idk what else exists
* im noob
