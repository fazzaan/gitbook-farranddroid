# Admin apps crash during theme change

I definitely don't have a solution for this yet, other than&#x20;

{% hint style="danger" %}
_don't change the theme while you have admin-powered apps open_
{% endhint %}

because they will crash.

It occurs to me that this is perhaps a reason why GNOME _still_ doesn't have an automated dark theme scheduler built into the system settings. Because _come on_, it can't be that hard to programme can it?
