# Input Methods - Fcitx5

On this page:

1. Setting up and configuring Fcitx5, an input method _**plugin engine**_ which connects to any input method software that has an Fcitx5 plugin.
2. Screenshots of configuration because it's horrible.
3. Other problems with input methods, and potentially mention fixes but idk if there are any.
