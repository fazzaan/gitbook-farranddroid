# Emoji Input

Ubuntu and GNOME have in-built emoji picker methods.

Of course, these didn't work in Wayland for the longest time.

Now, they do, but still don't work in non-GTK apps, which is hilarious given that _most apps that most people use are not GTK_, but who am I to judge?

Anyway,&#x20;

as it's seemingly beyond any developers' abilities (and I'd know cos I've been subscribed to the google groups mailing list for _**input method support in chromium under wayland**_ for literally years (maybe more than 8?) and nothing has happened yet),

a tonne of indie developers have come up with their own solutions.

They're all a bit not-ideal, but several of them work very nicely.

My favourite one so far is a GNOME extension that lives in the panel, and can be activated using the same keyboard shortcut as you're used to from Windows (and I think you can customise it too).

The only issue is that, in some apps, it doesn't insert automatically, and in some others (notably gedit, GNOME's own notepad editor), it actually does something funky to the text cursor.
