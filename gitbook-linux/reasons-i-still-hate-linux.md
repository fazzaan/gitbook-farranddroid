# Reasons I still Hate Linux

## Reasons that Linux is Still Shite

I've been away from Linux for 6+ years.

I used to use it as my main driver, from age 11 to age \~23.

Now it is 2025.

Today (21st September 2025), I decided to install Linux on my second cheapy laptop. I bought it second-hand last year when my real laptop's screen finally bit the dust, but it's really just not strong enough to run Windows 11 these days. I spent weeks trying to decrease the system load to make it run better, but tbh I haven't tried the variety of "debloated" Windowses. Honestly I only use Windows because I need MSÂ Office and Photoshop (amongst other apps), which (last I checked) still run like Jank on Wine, Proton[^1] etc.&#x20;

So today I took the plunge and installed Garuda Linux, a branch of customised Arch btw, and so far it's doing great. However.:

Here is a list of shitty things that STILL DON'T WORK PROPERLY:



* ## TOUCHPAD SCROLLING IS WAY TOO FAST



* ## CHROM/IUM DOESN'T HAVE MIDDLE-CLICK SCROLL



* ## TOUCHPAD SCROLLING IN CHROMIUM&#x20;



* ## GOOGLE DRIVE STILL DOESN'T HAVE A NATIVE SYNC APP



* ## INPUT METHOD CONFIGURATION IS HORRIFYING



* ## SWITCHING IME TOO FAST ACTIVATES OTHER SHORTCUTS



* ## CUSTOM GESTURES REQUIRES SPECIFIC COMMAND LINE



* ## MY WIFI IS HALF THE SPEED I GET ON WINDOWS



* ## CHANGING THEME CAUSES ADMIN-RELATED GTK APPS TO CRASH



* ## GTK HAS REMOVED CTRL+TAB FOR TAB SWITCHING, REPLACED IT WITH ALT+NUMBER, AND CTRL+TAB MOVES FOCUS SO THAT ALT+NUMBER DOESN'T EVEN WORK



Do you understand yet why Normal People are never going to use Linux?
