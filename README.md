I hope anything on it can support you somehow!

I pour my heart and soul into these websites because I want to share the knowledge I've discovered and compiled from throughout my life, because it has helped me grow and learn to love life, learn how to heal, learn how to learn and how to overcome struggles. I can't, and don't want to, monetise this information, so I create it and release it freely. If it benefits you and you can afford to, please consider supporting my work ðŸ˜Š

Farran + And + Droid â†’ Farr And Droid â†’ **FarrAndDroid**&#x20;

_I tried to merge "Farran" and "Android" but, unsurprisingly, Google have trademarked the word "Android" and also disallowed the creation of any Gmail addresses with "android" in them. (This is sensible as it prevents spoofing and phishing etc.) Therefore, I added another â€˜dâ€™, for "and"._
