**`🤖 welcome to my site`**

I hope anything on it can support you somehow!

If you something to be explained more clearly, you are more than welcome to message me about it. I'll explain it in a different way, and maybe that explanation will replace the one currently on this site.

<mark style="color:red;">“Why are there 2 Ds in ‘</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">farranddroid</mark>_<mark style="color:red;">’?”</mark>

I tried to merge "Farran" and "Android" but, unsurprisingly, Google have trademarked the word "Android" and also disallowed the creation of any Gmail addresses with "android" in them. (This is sensible as it prevents spoofing and phishing etc.) Therefore, I added another "d" for "and":

Farran + And + Droid → Farr And Droid → FarrAndDroid
