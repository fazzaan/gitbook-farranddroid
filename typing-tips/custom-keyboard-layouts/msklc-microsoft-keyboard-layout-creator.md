# MSKLC (MicroSoft Keyboard Layout Creator)

I've used this software for a few years, but only to a basic level. I recently found a user-written guide explaining how to use it for much deeper keyboard modification, beyond the limitations imposed by the GUI app.

View that MSKLC guide here: [https://msklc-guide.github.io/](https://msklc-guide.github.io/)

It's pretty easy to make keyboard layouts for Windows. There are certainly some pain points, but you'll work it out.

On Linux, it's quite a headache, it has to be said.&#x20;

I'll put that guide on my Linux space, I'll link you to it when it's ready.
