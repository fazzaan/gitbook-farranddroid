# Torrenting

"_Where there's a will, there's a way."_

Or, I can't stop you doing things, so it's better to teach you the safest ways to do it and how to be careful, than to try to prevent you from doing it altogether.

_If only our governments thought this way too._

## Desktop apps



### DON'T USE UTORRENT

utorrent is just an advertising platform these days.

And fuq knows what data it is tracking and gathering about you and your devices.

### qBittorrent

[→ qBittorrent homepage](https://www.qbittorrent.org/)&#x20;

Open source, free, quite customisable. qBittorrent does probably everything you could want from it.

It runs on the main computer OSes: Linux, macOS and Windows; and even OS/2, FreeBSD and Haiku[^1].

It supports dark mode.

Its UI is built in QT, hence the name _&#x71;_&#x42;ittorrent.

### Transmission

[→ Transmission homepage](https://transmissionbt.com/)&#x20;

Transmission is a very lightweight app and runs on all the major OS platforms.&#x20;

It also has a web UI, and can run a background daemon service.

On Linux, it has a dark mode that matches the GTK settings (and maybe QT settings under KDE). On Windows it doesn't seem to have a dark mode.
