## Plex

I can't really remember why but I don't really recommend Plex.

I used to _try_ to use Plex, but it kept getting in my way, forcing me to sign in, I guess trying to elbow me into paying for the subscription.

But JellyFin does everything I want actually, so once I found that, I haven't looked back.

Explore Plex if you like but I'm not gonna waste either of our time by discussing it here.
