# Abandonware

Some projects have just been abandoned. Always for various and probably reasonable reasons, but it's still sad nonetheless.

Nostr seems to have massive momentum behind it, it's reached a kind of critical mass, so I don't think it's going to fizzle out.

ZeroNet looked great, but it got abandoned a few years ago.
