# Nostr Network

{% hint style="info" %}
_basic info about the technology, its construct, its use-cases, etc_
{% endhint %}

Here is more information about using the network than about the technical aspects of it.&#x20;

Move some of the info from the other page ([nostr protocol](../projects-using-decentralized-networking/nostr-protocol.md))&#x20;

## Before you get started

Some key points to be aware of and understand properly before you try Nostr out:

1. Nostr is a protocol for **object transfer**, _it is **not** a social network_, it is **not** a specific application or website
2. Social networking has been built on top of the Nostr protocol
3. A vast array of apps can interact with the same Nostr objects
4. When you publish an object, it has a type (post, image, article, etc), it is signed by your encryption key, and it gets relayed from your device to other devices that are also connected to a Nostr network relay (like a server, but not a centralised server, not owned by a corporation etc)
5. You register for a Nostr ID. You save the public ID and the private key. You lose these, you permanently lose access to your "account". Someone else gains the private key, they have access to your account.
6. Your public ID key is your most fundamental "handle", address. You can bind human-readable handles to it, but that's a topic for later.
7. A Nostr account is NOT an "account" like the traditional centralised server-based networks. All of your posts are simply objects that get signed by your Nostr key, which identifies them as yours, and gives you some level of edit and delete control over them.
8. There are many many sites and apps that can access Nostr. They are not all at equal feature parity, and some may not be secure or trustworthy.. we have to make our own choices and understand the tech of what we're using.
9. There's a lot of crypto currency stuff on there... If you're not into that, don't let it put you off, it's not only for that stuff.
10. I haven't yet found a pool of people who are interested in my interests, but it'll take time to find them, and take time for the space to build up a critical mass. I'm staying a bit active there, it seems to be the best implementation of such a concept so far.
