# What do I need, to get started?

## Things to accept:

1. accept that you will need to pay for some things
2. accept that most services will be less convenient and more awkward
3. accept that you can never be sure that you have full security and privacy and anonymity and encryption: you should _always_ assume that you might be being watched
4. accept that you might need to buy new devices that are better supported by what you need
5. accept that you might have to sacrifice power & convenience by using virtual machines etc.

## Things to get:

### Internet space

* email — encrypted, burnable handles, etc — NOTHING from Google etc
* calendar solution (i reall don't know)
* notes service
* decentralised media — Nostr, etc (BlueSky is not decentralised afaik[^1])
* federated social media — Mastodon, etc (Meta's Threads _does not count_)
* encrypted communication methods — no "end to end" shite from mega corporations, that's all blatantly false. Telegram also doesn't count.
* anonymous communication methods — MUST be paired with VPNs, Tor, etc

### Computer use

* web browser — Firefox etc, NO CHROMIUM-BASED ANYTHING
* Tor browser if anonymity is required&#x20;
* firewalls — block connections by default&#x20;
* VPN&#x20;
* DNS and/or WARP&#x20;
* good antivirus&#x20;
* file storage — local backup, cloud backup if you want — NOT GOOGLE etc
* safe operating system —&#x20;
  * no Apple (especially not since their latest M CPUs with crazy undetectable memory access security issues)
  * no Windows unless you manage to find sane & up-to-date guides on how to disable all the spyware and telemetry — this seems to be possible, especially if you're running a stripped-down version of Windows or have tight firewall configurations
  * no Linux that has been tainted by corporate fingers (Ubuntu/Canonical are suspicious)&#x20;
  * Linux distros like _Tails_ are probably best for anonymity, but aren't idel as daily drivers. Most _Tails_ users just boot it up as and when required. (Actually this is best practice anyway.)&#x20;
* F/OSS apps for your personal & work life, such as office, desktop publishing, graphic editing, etc. All the proprietary apps are closed-source, so you _cannot_ know what information they are collecting about you and your devices, nor who they're giving/selling it to.

### Phone use

* no iphone. I'm dead serious.
* No stock Android. Research first, choose a phone that has a stable and well-supported AOSP ROM, then install your chosen ROM to replace the stock ROM on your phone. (Follow the instructions and read the recent forum posts, else you may brick your phone.)&#x20;
* Keep your phone in aeroplane mode as much as possible — although idk if this actually disables the mobile radio devices or not

## if you're a programmer, you'll also need:

* code IDE — VSCodium is the exact codebase of VS Code, just without Microsoft's spyware
* github alternatives — gitlab, bitbucket, etc
* programming languages that aren't distributed by google etc
