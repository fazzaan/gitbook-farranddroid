# VPN â€” the only real privacy

DNS services circumvent DNS-based blocks.

Encrypted DNS services hide your traffic, but it could still be snooped upon, and it is still tied to your IP address, location and device. You can be identified by it.

WARP is another step further than DNS, but it still is not fully secure.

A VPN service is truly the only way that you can gain real privacy.

But the ONLY way to ensure safety is to develop the habit of unpredictability.

If you have routines, regular behaviours, regular platforms, services, websites, etc., _you can be identified from your activities at any point in the future_. All\* VPN companies are businesses first and are liable to one day sell out on you. They may even be forced to comply with a law in a country, and thus give up your private information, such as your browsing logs and such.

If you are involved in immoral activities via your VPN then I couldn't give a fuck what happens to you. May justice be served.

But if you are involved in justice activism and other activities which are simply _illegal_ but not actually immoral, then by all means, go ahead and learn about VPNs.

Honestly, I'm not an expert on VPN usage, but I'm going to find out from some worthy voices and write some info here for you.
