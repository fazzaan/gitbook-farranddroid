# Account security — passwords, 2FA, keys, etc.

## Passwords, passkeys, etc.

Services:

* **Bitwarden** — can host in the USA, in the EU, or self-host.
* **Proton** — hosted in Switzerland. Stored with zero-knowledge encryption.



## Problems with each solution

### Proton Pass

* no duplicate cleaner, despite providing automatic importing from a wide range of password storage services. Not even available in the paid plan. Official recommendation is to export them all, open them in a spreadsheet app (Excel, Calc), clean them up manually, then re-import them to Proton Pass. Not ideal for regular usage. If you wish to use Proton as a complete platform, I personally would suggest using a service that has duplicate cleaning first, then export them from that and import them to Proton Pass.
