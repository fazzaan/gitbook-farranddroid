Microsoft Edge is basically spyware by this point in time.

That's not to say that all the other browsers aren't.

But, with Edge, Microsoft go several steps further. It's the default browser, all the spyware settings are on by default, the settings are fairly deeply hidden so it's hard to turn them off, and even on first launch of Edge you are greeted by several full-screen pages of information telling you that you must make choices now!!! Pages which obviously usher you towards giving them as much data as possible.

Turn this all off —

— unless you want to contribute to the construction of ~~the~~ one of many impending demiurges.

(Watch Westworld to realise what I mean.)

Details on how to do this will be available here soon, but in the mean time you can find many guides around the internet:
