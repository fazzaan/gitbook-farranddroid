# Setting up a new Windows 11 system

If you're anything like me, you'll have noticed there's a whole bunch of annoying af default settings in Windows. Gok knows _why_ it's like this, but like this is it. Having set up a bunch of new Windows installations for myself over the last few weeks, I've decided to share my personal configurations with you.

* Multi-tasking settings
* Touchpad gestures â€” useful & intuitive
* Language & Keyboard settings
  * Custom keyboard layouts
* Useful apps to make you into a "power-user"
* Upgrading Windows to a better version
* Media apps for streaming downloaded videos from your computer to your TV, phone, tablet

There are some tools which do all/most of this stuff for you automatically.

I haven't tested ANY of them (yet) and many of them do have a lot of naysayers online.

This is because a lot of them do "debloating" but they go _**too far**_, removing all kinds of background processes and apps that you do actually need for a stable, secure and functional operating system.

One promising tool is called Talon, by a team called Raven. I am going to test it soon.

## Frustrations

There are a bunch of typical frustrations that any seasoned Windows (or other OS) user will have with a new installation of Windows. Here are a few examples:

* Context menu is slow, annoying, and somewhat useless. _See_ [right-click-menu.md](right-click-menu.md "mention") _to resolve._&#x20;
