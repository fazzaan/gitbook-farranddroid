### _G-Helper_ alternative to Asus's _Armoury Crate_

Asus ROG laptops have the infamous "Armoury Crate". Somehow, Asus forgot to include any way of locking the Fn keys on or off — and it does seem to be a genuine oversight because some people have got it locked on, and for others it's off!

An independent developer Serge ([seerge](https://github.com/seerge)) has coded a lightweight alternative to Asus's _Armoury Crate_, called _**G-Helper**_, which features everything important from _Armoury Crate_ and has additional features, including the Fn-lock ability.&#x20;
